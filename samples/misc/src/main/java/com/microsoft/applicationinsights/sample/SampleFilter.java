/**
 * Sample filter
 * This class is an example for having a custom filter that can filter out unneded telemetries.
 * To have one, you should implement {@link TelemetryProcessor} and implement its 'process' method.
 *
 * The method gets a {@link Telemetry} instance that is ready to be sent. This is your chance to approve
 * or deny it. Returning 'false' means that the Telemetry will not be sent while 'true' means you approve it.
 *
 * The Telemetry might go through other filters though, that might deny its sending.
 *
 * To enable this processor you need to add it in the ApplicationInsights.xml like this:
 *
 *
 * {@code
 <TelemetryProcessors>

     <CustomProcessors>
        <Processor type="com.microsoft.applicationinsights.sample.SampleFilter">
            <Add name="Pass" value="false"/>
        </Processor>
    </CustomProcessors>

 </TelemetryProcessors>
}
 *
 * Note that the class defines a property named 'pass' which is configured too.
 * Every property that you wish to configure needs to have a 'setX' public method like 'setPass' in this example
 * <b>Exceptions thrown from the 'setX' methods will be caught by the framework that will ignore the filter</b>
 *
