/**
 * Created by yonisha on 2/16/2015.
 *
 * This class validates the ThreadContext class.
 * The idea is simple: store a request telemetry context using TLS and then getting it back
 * to validate the expected value.
 * This class should be called concurrently to increase the probability of other threads (validators)
 * interrupting each other, and therefore identify potential bugs.
 * Concurrent invocations of this calls basically simulates concurrent http requests on a web server.
